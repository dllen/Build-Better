# NES ROMs Directory

## Legal Notice

Due to copyright restrictions, this repository **does not** contain commercial ROM files (e.g., Super Mario Bros., Zelda, Contra).
Users are responsible for providing their own legally obtained backup copies of games they own.

## How to Add Games

1. Place your `.nes` files in this directory (`public/roms/`).
2. Ensure the filenames match the configuration in `src/data/nesGames.ts`:
   - `super_mario_bros.nes`
   - `contra.nes`
   - `zelda.nes`
   - ...and so on.

## Included Test ROMs

We have included a legal test ROM for verification purposes:

- **nestest.nes**: A CPU instruction test suite by Kevtris.
  - Useful for verifying that the emulator core is running correctly.
  - Select "NES Test (CPU Test)" in the emulator to run it.
