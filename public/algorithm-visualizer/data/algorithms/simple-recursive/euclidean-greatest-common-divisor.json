        "content": "# Euclidean Greatest Common Divisor\n\nIn mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm,\nis an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor\n(GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of\nthem without leaving a remainder.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the\ngreatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if\nthe larger number is replaced by its difference with the\nsmaller number. For example, `21` is the GCD of `252` and\n`105` (as `252 = 21 × 12` and `105 = 21 × 5`), and the same\nnumber `21` is also the GCD of `105` and `252 − 105 = 147`.\nSince this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers,\nrepeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of\nnumbers until the two numbers become equal.\nWhen that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\nBy reversing the steps, the GCD can be expressed as a sum of\nthe two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or\nnegative integer, e.g., `21 = 5 × 105 + (−2) × 252`.\nThe fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is\nknown as Bézout's identity.\n\n![GCD](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Euclid%27s_algorithm_Book_VII_Proposition_2_3.png)\n\nEuclid's method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nof two starting lengths `BA` and `DC`, both defined to be\nmultiples of a common \"unit\" length. The length `DC` being\nshorter, it is used to \"measure\" `BA`, but only once because\nremainder `EA` is less than `DC`. EA now measures (twice)\nthe shorter length `DC`, with remainder `FC` shorter than `EA`.\nThen `FC` measures (three times) length `EA`. Because there is\nno remainder, the process ends with `FC` being the `GCD`.\nOn the right Nicomachus' example with numbers `49` and `21`\nresulting in their GCD of `7` (derived from Heath 1908:300).\n\n![GCD](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/24x60.svg)\n\nA `24-by-60` rectangle is covered with ten `12-by-12` square\ntiles, where `12` is the GCD of `24` and `60`. More generally,\nan `a-by-b` rectangle can be covered with square tiles of\nside-length `c` only if `c` is a common divisor of `a` and `b`.\n\n![GCD](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Euclidean_algorithm_1071_462.gif)\n\nSubtraction-based animation of the Euclidean algorithm.\nThe initial rectangle has dimensions `a = 1071` and `b = 462`.\nSquares of size `462×462` are placed within it leaving a\n`462×147` rectangle. This rectangle is tiled with `147×147`\nsquares until a `21×147` rectangle is left, which in turn is\ntiled with `21×21` squares, leaving no uncovered area.\nThe smallest square size, `21`, is the GCD of `1071` and `462`.\n\n## References\n\n- [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/math/euclidean-algorithm)\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)\n",
