A magic square has the same number of rows as it has columns, and in conventional math notation, 'n' stands for the number of rows (and columns) it has. Thus, a magic square always contains n2 numbers, and its size (the number of rows [and columns] it has) is described as being of order n. A magic square that contains the integers from 1 to n2 is called a normal magic square. (The term magic square is also sometimes used to refer to any of various types of word squares.)\n\n## Complexity\n* **Time**:  ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(N^2))\n* **Space**: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(N^2))\n\n## References\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square)",
