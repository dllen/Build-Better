The eight queens puzzle is an example of the\nmore general *n queens problem* of placing n non-attacking queens\non an `n×n` chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural\nnumbers `n` with the exception of `n=2` and `n=3`.\n\nFor example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.\n\n![N Queens](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/N_Queen_Problem.jpg)\n\nThe expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks\nwhere queens are placed. For example following is the output matrix\nfor above 4 queen solution.\n\n```\n{ 0,  1,  0,  0}\n{ 0,  0,  0,  1}\n{ 1,  0,  0,  0}\n{ 0,  0,  1,  0}\n```\n\n## Naive Algorithm\n\nGenerate all possible configurations of queens on board and print a\nconfiguration that satisfies the given constraints.\n\n```\nwhile there are untried configurations\n{\n   generate the next configuration\n   if queens don't attack in this configuration then\n   {\n      print this configuration;\n   }\n}\n```\n\n## Backtracking Algorithm\n\nThe idea is to place queens one by one in different columns,\nstarting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a\ncolumn, we check for clashes with already placed queens. In\nthe current column, if we find a row for which there is no\nclash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution.\nIf we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack\nand return false.\n\n```\n1) Start in the leftmost column\n2) If all queens are placed\n    return true\n3) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following for every tried row.\n    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row then mark this [row,\n        column] as part of the solution and recursively check if placing\n        queen here leads to a solution.\n    b) If placing queen in [row, column] leads to a solution then return\n        true.\n    c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then umark this [row,\n        column] (Backtrack) and go to step (a) to try other rows.\n3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger\n    backtracking.\n```\n\n## Bitwise Solution\n\nBitwise algorithm basically approaches the problem like this:\n\n- Queens can attack diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. As a result, there\ncan only be one queen in each row, one in each column, and at most one on each\ndiagonal.\n- Since we know there can only one queen per row, we will start at the first row,\nplace a queen, then move to the second row, place a second queen, and so on until\neither a) we reach a valid solution or b) we reach a dead end (ie. we can't place\na queen such that it is \"safe\" from the other queens).\n- Since we are only placing one queen per row, we don't need to worry about\nhorizontal attacks, since no queen will ever be on the same row as another queen.\n- That means we only need to check three things before placing a queen on a\ncertain square: 1) The square's column doesn't have any other queens on it, 2)\nthe square's left diagonal doesn't have any other queens on it, and 3) the\nsquare's right diagonal doesn't have any other queens on it.\n- If we ever reach a point where there is nowhere safe to place a queen, we can\ngive up on our current attempt and immediately test out the next possibility.\n\nFirst let's talk about the recursive function. You'll notice that it accepts\n3 parameters: `leftDiagonal`, `column`, and `rightDiagonal`. Each of these is\ntechnically an integer, but the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that an\ninteger is represented by a sequence of bits. So, think of each of these\nparameters as a sequence of `N` bits.\n\nEach bit in each of the parameters represents whether the corresponding location\non the current row is \"available\".\n\nFor example:\n- For `N=4`, column having a value of `0010` would mean that the 3rd column is\nalready occupied by a queen.\n- For `N=8`, ld having a value of `00011000` at row 5 would mean that the\ntop-left-to-bottom-right diagonals that pass through columns 4 and 5 of that\nrow are already occupied by queens.\n\nBelow is a visual aid for `leftDiagonal`, `column`, and `rightDiagonal`.\n\n![](http://gregtrowbridge.com/content/images/2014/Jul/Screenshot-from-2014-06-17-19-46-20.png)\n\n## References\n\n- [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/uncategorized/n-queens)\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)\n- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-set-3-n-queen-problem/)\n- [On YouTube by Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFv_Hl4B83A&list=PLLXdhg_r2hKA7DPDsunoDZ-Z769jWn4R8)\n- [On YouTube by Tushar Roy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xouin83ebxE&list=PLLXdhg_r2hKA7DPDsunoDZ-Z769jWn4R8)\n- Bitwise Solution\n  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)\n  - [Solution by Greg Trowbridge](http://gregtrowbridge.com/a-bitwise-solution-to-the-n-queens-problem-in-javascript/)\n",
