No it doesn't, Sarah. It tastes like oats, whey, and responsible decisions. But we're flattered.

**CHANGELOG · JULY 2026**

# Nebula CLI 2.4

Deploy previews, one-command rollbacks, and a cold start that's 40% less cold.
:::

The release you kept opening GitHub issues about — the three most-requested features, shipped in one go.

[Read the full changelog](https://example.com/changelog/2.4){button}

## Deploy previews, no dashboard required

Every branch gets a shareable preview URL straight from the CLI — or from the SDK if you'd rather script it:

\`\`\`js
import { nebula } from "@nebula/sdk";

const preview = await nebula.deploy({
  branch: "feat/checkout",
  env: "preview",
});

console.log(preview.url);
\`\`\`

::: spacer 16

::: divider color=#26272B

## Rollbacks in one command

Shipped a bug at 4:59 on a Friday? We've been there:

\`\`\`bash
nebula rollback --to v2.3.1
\`\`\`

Traffic shifts back in seconds, and the bad deploy stays archived for the postmortem.

::: spacer 16

::: divider color=#26272B

## A cold start that's 40% less cold

::: chart max=520
Cold start, p50 across every region — lower is better.

- Nebula 2.3: 420ms {color=#4B4B55}
- Nebula 2.4: 250ms
:::

Same runtime, same regions. We just stopped re-reading the bundle on every boot.

### Breaking changes
\`nebula env pull\` now writes to \`.env.local\` instead of \`.env\`. If your scripts read the old path, update them before upgrading.

### How do I upgrade?
Run \`npm i -g @nebula/cli\` — config and login sessions carry over automatically.
